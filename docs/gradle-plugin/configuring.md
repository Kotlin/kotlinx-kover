## Configuring default reports

The full configuration for default reports is given below.
These reports are avialable by default when Kover is applied by tasks such as  `:koverHtmlReport` and `:koverXmlReport`.

## Reports filtering
Report filtering is used to exclude one or more classes from the report, and so that they are not taken into account during verification.

Filters consist of inclusion and exclusion rules.
Exclusion rules are names of the classes that must be excluded from the report. Inclusion rules are the classes that should be included in the report, all other classes are excluded from the report.

If inclusion and exclusion rules are specified at the same time, then excludes have priority over includes.
This means that even if a class is specified in both the inclusion and exclusion rules, it will be excluded from the report (e.g. class `com.example.Class1` above).

[Wildcards](#class-name-with-wildcards) `*` and `?` are allowed in class names.

There are several levels where you can define filters. Each of the levels has its own priority.
```kotlin

koverReport {
    // common filters for all reports
    filters {
        excludes {
            // exclusions for all reports
        }
        includes {
            // inclusions for all reports
        }
    }
  
    defaults {
        // overriding filters for default reports 
        filters {
            excludes {
                // exclusions for default reports
            }
            includes {
                // inclusions for default reports
            }
        }
      
        xml {
            // overriding filters for default xml report 
            filters {
              excludes {  }
              includes {  }
            }
        }
    }  
    androidReports("release") {
        // overriding filters for reports for `release` build variant 
        filters {
            excludes {
                // exclusions for reports for `release` build variant 
            }
            includes {
                // inclusions for default reports for `release` build variant 
            }
        }
      
        xml {
            // overriding filters for xml report for `release` build variant  
            filters {
              excludes {  }
              includes {  }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Filter definition levels in ascending order of priority:
- common level - applies to all Kover reports in the current project
- variant level - used for Kover reports for default tasks or some Android build variant
- report level - specifies the xml or html filters of the report, or verification, for the default variant or Android build variant
- verification rule level - applies only to one specific verification rule

If a higher priority filter is specified, it completely replaces the rules written by the level above.
By specifying an empty filter `filters { }`, you can completely disable report filtering.

## Class name with wildcards

Inclusion/exclusion value rules:

* Should be a fully-qualified class name.
* Can contain wildcards:
    * `*` for zero or more of any char.
    * `**` is the same as `*`.
    * `?` for one of any char.
* File and directory names are not allowed.

Examples:

* (good) `my.package.ClassName`
* (good) `my.*.*Name`
* (bad) `my/package/ClassName.kt`
* (bad) `src/my.**.ClassName`

## Verification
When checking a certain verification rule, the entire code is divided into units of code for which it determines whether it was covered (executed) or skipped (not executed).
For example, an entire line from source code or a specific JVM instruction from compiled byte-code can be executed or not.

All units are grouped into one or more groups. 
Based on amount of the executed and non-executed code units, one number (current value) will be calculated for each group using the aggregation function.

It is this current value of the group that will be compared with the minimum and maximum boundaries specified in the configuration.

Type `MetricType` determines for which types of units the coverage will be measured.
It is:
 - `LINE`
 - `INSTRUCTION`
 - `BRANCH`

For comparison with the specified boundaries, the number of covered (executed) or skipped (not executed) units should be aggregated into one number.
`AggregationType` determines exactly how the current measurement value will be calculated:
- `COVERED_COUNT` - the total number of units of code that were executed
- `MISSED_COUNT` - the total number of units of code that were not executed
- `COVERED_PERCENTAGE` - is the number of covered units divided by the number of all units and multiplied by 100
- `MISSED_PERCENTAGE` - is the number of uncovered units divided by the number of all units and multiplied by 100

To calculate the current value, units are grouped by various entities.
By default, all application units of code are grouped by a single application entity, so one current value is calculated for the entire application using the aggregating function.

But you can group code units by other named entities.
The `GroupingEntityType` type is used for this:
- `APPLICATION` - one current coverage value for the entire application will be calculated
- `CLASS` - the current value will be calculated individually for each class. So the bounds will be checked for each class
- `PACKAGE` - the current value will be calculated individually for all classes in each package. So the bounds will be checked for each package

## Merging reports
If it is necessary to generate a report for a specific build variant using the Kover default report tasks, it is possible to combine the contents of the Android report and the default report.

This is done by configuring default reports
```
koverReport {
    defaults {
        mergeWith("release")
    }
}
```
This will add the reports contents of `release` Android build variant to default reports.

This can be useful if only one command is run in a multimodule project for uniformity, instead of many different ones for each module.
Or if in a multiplatform project it is necessary to generate a single report for JVM and Android targets.

**If the report for the build variant was added to the default report, the measurements for this variant are exported and will be used in dependencies.**
